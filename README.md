## Choose Your Own Adventure

A modern implementation of a timeless story format--allowing users to shape the direction and ending of a narrative through their own choices really first became popular on iOS devices with the release of **Lifeline**. The attention of this successful interactive story by 3 Minute Games in 2015 sparked a series as well as many competing "Choose Your Own Adventure" games.

This app showcases how such a game could be built using Apple's programming language, Swift.
